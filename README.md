# ViaChatFixer 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MrMicky-FR/ViaChatFixer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MrMicky-FR/ViaChatFixer)

ViaChatFixer is a Spigot plugin that allow 1.11+ players to have longer chat messages on 1.8-1.10 servers with ViaVersion

In 1.11, the maximum length has gone from 100 characters to 256 characters.
If your server is under 1.11, 1.11 and higher clients will have their chat messages cut at 100 characters, but not with this plugin ;)

**The plugin is currently in beta, so if you find bugs please open a issue**

## Installation
Just put the ViaChatFixer jar in your plugins folder.
Actually this plugin only works on Spigot, Sponge support should be add soon.
This plugin can work with BungeeCord as long as ViaVersion and this plugin are on the Spigot servers.

## Planned features
* Sponge support
* BungeeCord support
