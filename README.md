# ViaChatFixer 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MrMicky-FR/ViaChatFixer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MrMicky-FR/ViaChatFixer)

ViaChatFixer is a Spigot plugin that allow 1.11+ players to have longer chat messages on 1.8-1.10 servers with ViaVersion

In Minecraft 1.11, the maximum messages length has gone from 100 characters to 256 characters.
So if your server is under 1.11, 1.11 and higher players will have their chat messages cut at 100 characters.

This plugin fix this problem, so 1.11 and higher players will able to send longer chat messages up to 256 characters :)

**The plugin is currently in beta, so if you find bugs please open an issue**

## Installation
Just put the ViaChatFixer jar in your plugins folder.
Currently this plugin only works on Spigot, but Sponge support should be added soon.
This plugin can work with BungeeCord as long as ViaVersion and this plugin are on the Spigot servers.

**All players online during a reload will not be able to have longer chat messages until they reconnect**

## Planned features
* Sponge support
* BungeeCord support
